# Battle System


## Ability points

Units have action points which can spent during a turn to use on their abilities or attacks. Each turn, a set amount of action points is refilled to every unit.
Each Ablity can only be used once per turn.

## Collosal units weak points

Units that have a size greater than 1x1x1 can have weak points or simply certain parts that can be attacked to deal extra dmg to them or can be desroyed to
disable certain abilities or weapons. For example, you can attack a MonkeyLord's legs so it disables its movement.

Big units may have parts with their own health. Dealing damage to this parts also damages the main unit.
Some big units simply don't have destroyable parts, so only the main unit health is relevant.
