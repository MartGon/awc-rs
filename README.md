# awc-rs
Advance Wars Clone - Made in Rust

## Description

**awc-rs** is a work in progress clone of the game boy advance game, **Advance Wars**. The idea is to create an engine capable of recreating the original game, while mainting a clean design which allows modifications to the orignal formula, such as triggered effects based on events, different attack and movement patterns, new tiles and units, etc.
